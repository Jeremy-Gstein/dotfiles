# dotfiles
personal dotfiles for i3, polybar, .zshrc
### Usage
clone the repo, `cd dotfiles` then make `./dotfiles/install.sh` executable with `chmod +x`
---
#### This is a little theme I've been working in spare time for a simplistic i3 Arch Linux enviroment. Becuase this was developed originally for personal use, some alias's in .zshrc should be removed.
---
### Why?
- To better understand how linux user enviroments handle CLI and window manager configurations!
---
### ToDo
- Add links to documentation/resources for utilities used (i3, polybar, etc...)
