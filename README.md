#### This is a little theme I've been working in spare time for a simplistic i3 Arch Linux enviroment. Becuase this was developed originally for personal use, some alias's in .zshrc should be removed.

### Why?
- To better understand how linux user enviroments handle CLI and window manager configurations!
